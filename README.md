# hello-world
my first Github repository!

I'm a sourcer at Facebook, hiring engineers who want to make the world more open and connected. As of March 2016, we have over 1 billion daily active users, approximately 84.2% of which are outside of the US and Canada. 

Do you value an environment that rewards being bold (building great things means taking risks! we believe the riskiest thing is to take no risks), being open (an open world is a better world; more information = better decisions + greater impact!), moving fast (we innovate rapidly and learn quickly from our mistakes. everyone is a builder and can make an impact), and most importantly -- do you love to #ShipLove? we care about our people, both employees and people who are connected to our product in one way or another. 

Do you want to create delightful experiences seen by over 1 billion people around the world every day?
Do you want to help us scale our systems to our next billions of users and beyond? 

Join us and make your mark on the world.
